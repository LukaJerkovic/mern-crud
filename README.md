NOTE : 
If you want to run a project, you need to add a .env file in the root of your server folder. Your .env file needs to contain a PORT which is equal to port number you wish to use for server and MONGODB with URI connection string
to your mongodb database.
EXAMPLE :
PORT=8000
MONGODB=mongodb+srv://username:password@clustername.wtoz4ww.mongodb.net/databasename
